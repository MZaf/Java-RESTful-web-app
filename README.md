The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, 
persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database. 
JPA was defined as part of the EJB 3.0 specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification.

This REST controller handles URL end-points that start with /process.
startProcess is called when the URL is /process/start. This is a POST
request. The data in the POST request is mapped to a Process object which
is a domain object from leris-domain. The mapping is done automatically by
spring-rest.

Inside startProcess function, we donâ€™t implement any business logic. It makes
some application logic related setups and then delegates the actual functionality
to ProcessService object which resides in the service layer.
